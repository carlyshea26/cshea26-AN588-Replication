---

These different datasets are in a CSV format to be used in the R script provided. Some datasets were used to create  figures in the associated paper, which numbers are in brackets.

## Description of the Data and file structure

Datasets contain measurements of three different fin whale parameters (internote interval and peak frequencies of the 20-Hz and higher frequency notes sorted by song (or day, since only one song was analysed per day). Measurements were made by the acoustic software Raven Pro 1.5 and then transferred to a database. The following datasets are included:

*   "Year"- referring to singing season (October through March) thus covering two years at a time

*   "Ave_PF"- averaged peak frequencies of  20-Hz notes by song and day
*   "SD_PF"-standard deviation of peak frequencies of 20-Hz notes by song and day
*   "Num_INI"-number of INIs measured.

HF_ave: contains peak frequencies of the high frequency (HF) note averaged by song (or day) and its standard deviations sorted location, region and year (Figure 3C in paper). Column headers are the following: 

*   "Region"- regions as described in "Sampling locations" from the paper's methods section
*   "Location" - locations as described in "Sampling locations" from the paper's methods section
